\value{
A folder at \verb{inst/RxClass API/\{version\}/omop/\{timestamp\}} containing
a README with csvs.
}
\description{
Collect, load, and extract RxClass API responses
into CONCEPT, CONCEPT_ANCESTOR, and CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP csvs
as part of package installation directory.
}
\details{
ATC classTypes and relaSources are excluded by default, but may be
included if desired by adding both 'ATC1-4' to \code{class_types} and
'ATC' to \code{rela_sources}.

All API responses are cached using both the RxClass Version and API Version
as the key. Depending on how much of the API responses are cached, this
script can take multiple days if not weeks.

Since the output folder is a timestamp folder, many duplicate versions
can be made each time it is run. There is no QA method that will crosscheck
a previous version against the current version.
